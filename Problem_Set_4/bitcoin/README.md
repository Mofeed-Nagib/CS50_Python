# Bitcoin Price Index

[Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) is a form of digital currency, otherwise known as [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency). Rather than rely on a central authority like a bank, Bitcoin instead relies on a distributed network, otherwise known as a [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain), to record transactions.

Because thereâ€™s demand for Bitcoin (i.e., users want it), users are willing to buy it, as by exchanging one currency (e.g., USD) for Bitcoin.

In a file called `bitcoin.py`, implement a program that:

- Expects the user to specify as a command-line argument the number of Bitcoins, _n_, that they would like to buy. If that argument cannot be converted to a `float`, the program should exit via `sys.exit` with an error message.
- Queries the API for the CoinCap Bitcoin Price Index at [rest.coincap.io/v3/assets/bitcoin?apiKey=YourApiKey](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/4/bitcoin/rest.coincap.io/v3/assets/bitcoin?apiKey=YourApiKey). You should replace `YourApiKey` with the actual API key you obtained from your CoinCap account dashboard, which returns a [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) object, among whose nested keys is the current price of Bitcoin as a `float`. Be sure to catch any [exceptions](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/#exceptions), as with code like:
    ```
    import requests
    
    try:
        ...
    except requests.RequestException:
        ...
    ```
- Outputs the current cost of _n_ Bitcoins in USD to four decimal places, using `,` as a thousands separator.
