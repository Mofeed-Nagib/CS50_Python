# NUMB3RS

In Season 5, Episode 23 of [NUMB3RS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_(TV_series)), a supposed [IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) appears on screen, `275.3.6.28`, which isn’t actually a valid [IPv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4) (or [IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6)) address.

An IPv4 address is a numeric identifier that a device (or, on TV, hacker) uses to communicate on the internet, akin to a postal address in the real world, typically formatted in [dot-decimal notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-decimal_notation) as `#.#.#.#`. But each `#` should be a number between `0` and `255`, inclusive. Suffice it to say `275` is not in that range! If only NUMB3RS had validated the address in that scene!

In a file called `numb3rs.py`, implement a function called `validate` that expects an IPv4 address as input as a `str` and then returns `True` or `False`, respectively, if that input is a valid IPv4 address or not.

Structure `numb3rs.py` as follows, wherein you’re welcome to modify `main` and/or implement other functions as you see fit, but you may not import any other libraries. You’re welcome, but not required, to use `re` and/or `sys`.

```
import re
import sys


def main():
    print(validate(input("IPv4 Address: ")))


def validate(ip):
    ...


...


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Either before or after you implement `validate` in `numb3rs.py`, additionally implement, in a file called `test_numb3rs.py`, two or more functions that collectively test your implementation of `validate` thoroughly, each of whose names should begin with `test_` so that you can execute your tests with:

```
pytest test_numb3rs.py
```
