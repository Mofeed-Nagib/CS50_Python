# Deep Thought

<blockquote>
"All right," said the computer, and settled into silence again. The two men fidgeted. The tension was unbearable. <br/>
"You’re really not going to like it," observed Deep Thought. <br/>
"Tell us!" <br/>
"All right," said Deep Thought. "The Answer to the Great Question…" <br/>
"Yes…!" <br/>
"Of Life, the Universe and Everything…" said Deep Thought. <br/>
"Yes…!" <br/>
"Is…" said Deep Thought, and paused. <br/>
"Yes…!" <br/>
"Is…" <br/>
"Yes…!!!…?" <br/>
"Forty-two," said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm." <br/> <br/>

In `deep.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for the answer to the Great Question of Life, the Universe and Everything, outputting `Yes` if the user inputs `42` or (case-insensitively) `forty-two` or `forty two`. Otherwise output `No`.
